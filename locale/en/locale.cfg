[mod-setting-description]
rampant--squadCompressionThreshold=Will compress biter groups into one unit of each type upto 6 types with a number representing how many units were compressed. Decompression will take place when the groups gets close to player, player structures, or loses a unit. -1 means disabled. Any number above -1 is the minimum number of units in a unit group that should be compressed.
rampant--legacyChunkScanning=Enabling this will cause Rampant to slowly scan chunks for resources, enemies, and player structures that are created or destroyed by mods that dont raise an event when creating or destroying entities.
rampant--maxBaseAlignmentHistory=The number of mutations that a base will remember. Remembered mutations cannot be mutated to again.
rampant--enableLandfillOnDeath=The body parts that are thrown off when dying will landfill water tiles. If Remove blood particles is enabled then this setting will not work.

rampant--max-base-mutations=Requires Rampant new enemies to have any affect. This number represents the number of times a regional faction group can mutate into other factions. Regional faction groups adapt over time typically to a faction that is strong against the type of damage they are being killed with. Death threshold for mutation is based on evolution. (17000 Deaths:<50% Evolution, 34000:<70%, 60000:<90%, 100000)
rampant--baseDistanceModifier=Modifies the distance between factions as a percentage change. Low percentages may impact performance.
rampant--printBaseAdaptation=Display a message to the chat console when a faction mutates based on the number of enemies killed
rampant--adaptationModifier=Modifies the number of units or enemy buildings that must be destroyed before the adaptation happens based on the damage types that killed the units or buildings. This modifier is a percentage change using the following as starting place (Default deaths events starts at 17000 under 0.5 evo, under 0.7 is 34000, under 0.9 is 60000, and +0.9 is 100000)
rampant--unitAndSpawnerFadeTime=The time in seconds for how long biter corpses stay around
rampant--unitsAffectedByTiles=Units are affected by tile movement modifiers
rampant--oldRedEnemyMapColor=Reverts the enemy map color to the vanilla enemy map color
rampant--unitSpawnerBreath=Now unit spawners breath air so they are affected by things like poison capsules
rampant--useDumbProjectiles=Use the projectile attacks that are blockable. This should be checked if you are using the new enemies.
rampant--attackWaveGenerationThresholdMax=The total score that a chunk must reach in order for an attack wave to spawn. DOES NOT affect vanilla biters waves. Scaling linearly with evolution factor (starting threshold @ 0.0 evolution)
rampant--attackWaveGenerationThresholdMin=The total score that a chunk must reach in order for an attack wave to spawn. DOES NOT affect vanilla biters waves. Scaling linearly with evolution factor (ending threshold @ 100.0 evolution)
rampant--attackWaveMaxSize=If you wish to change how the attack wave scales with evolution you will need to modify the config.lua in the zip file.
rampant--safeBuildings=This needs to be toggle for the safe building toggles to work. This will cause entities made safe to regenerate with the destructible flag set to false, which causes them to never be targeted or damaged again.
rampant--safeBuildings-curvedRail=Make curved rails safe from biters
rampant--safeBuildings-straightRail=Make straight rails safe from biters
rampant--safeBuildings-bigElectricPole=Make big electric poles safe from biters

rampant--permanentNocturnal=Toggling this will cause Rampant attack waves to spawn at night. Works better with the clockwork mod or a mod that extends night.
rampant--aiPointsScaler=Between 0.0 and 100.0. This scales how many action points the ai gets per logic cycle to perform actions like making attack waves. 0.3 - very easy, 0.75 - easy, 1.0 - medium, 1.25+ - hard
rampant--aiPointsPrintSpendingToChat=Print a message to chat whenever Rampant spends points. Includes GPS coordinates. Keep disabled for the hardest Rampant experience. Heads up: can fill up chat quickly during busy battles!
rampant--aiPointsPrintGainsToChat=Print a message to chat whenever Rampant gains points. Does not show passive point generation. Keep disabled for the hardest Rampant experience. Heads up: can fill up chat quickly during busy battles!
rampant--addWallResistanceAcid=Toggling this will cause a %60 acid resistance to be added to all wall entities to reduce the damage done by spitters to walls.
rampant--removeBloodParticles=The blood particles that are created when biters are being killed can cause UPS spikes, this removes them.
rampant--enableSwarm=This reduces the size of the unit collision_mask by 30% causing them to reduce pathing collisions and smooth out the attacks. Less needed since base factorio no longer has enemy units collide with each other.
rampant--attack-warning=Shows a message warning players that an attack wave is incoming
rampant--newEnemies=Adds news enemies that will be dispersed over the world. This increases the RAM requirements. With 1 variation for each biter, worm, and nest and 5 tiers expect upto a 2GB RAM increase. With 20 variations and 10 tiers set expect up to 9GB RAM increase. Variations add randomness to each tier of biter, worms, or nests. Tiers are the power level of the biters.
rampant--enemySeed=The seed that powers all of the unit generation, so change this if you want the enemy stats to change
rampant--deadZoneFrequency=The percentage of zones that start without worms or nests
rampant--newEnemyVariations=This number corresponds to the number of variations per tier. This adds randomness to each tier power level. Min 1, Max 20

Roughly healthwise each tier is a follows (1-15,2-75,3-150,4-250,5-1000,6-2000,7-3500,8-7500,9-15000,10-30000). min 1, max 10
rampant--tierEnd=This is the ending tier level that is reached after increasing linearly from the start tier for as many tiers selected. Roughly healthwise each tier is as follows (1-15,2-75,3-150,4-250,5-1000,6-2000,7-3500,8-7500,9-15000,10-30000). min 1, max 10
rampant--enableMigration=This will allow the ai to expand its worms and nests. Respects the map settings for biter expansion.
rampant--peacefulAIToggle=The Rampant AI can roll the peaceful state. If this is disabled and the biters roll the peaceful state, they are instead changed to aggressive or migrating state depending on AI: Enabled Migration setting. This does not relate to whether your map has Factorio's Peaceful Mode enabled or disabled. Disable for the hardest Rampant experience.
rampant--printAIStateChanges=Gives you information in the game chat about Rampant's AI state. Messages are displayed for each surface. Disable for the hardest Rampant experience.
rampant--debugTemperament=Prints to chat AI temperament information that controls AI state rolls. This is used for debugging.

rampant--enableShrinkNestsAndWorms=Reduce the collision box size of nests and worms by 25%. May cause overlapping entities due to the collision box being smaller than the entity graphic.
rampant--attackWaveGenerationUsePlayerProximity=Include player pheromones amount for threshold on chunks with biter nests that will generate a Rampant attack wave. DOES NOT affect vanilla biters waves
